This website is a personal feed that records my latests thoughts, findings, and experiences while programming. The hope is that this will also serve as documentation for the topics that I'm tackling and will prove useful for others in the same boat.

I won't restrain myself to a specific programming language but most posts will likely be in:
- Rust
- Scala
- Typescript

You can find the source code referenced in the blogs on [my github][personal-github].
