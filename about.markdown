This website is a personal feed that records my latests thoughts, findings, and experiences while programming. The hope is that this will also serve as documentation for the topics that I'm trying to tackle and will prove useful for anybody who has similar musings.

I won't restraint myself to a specific programming language here but most of my musings will likely be in Rust while simpler examples may be in Typescript, Scala, or Python.

You can find the majority of the source code referenced here on [my github][personal-github].
